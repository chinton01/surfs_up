### Summary: 
After conducting the analysis for the temperatures of June and December, we can infer that the surf and ice cream business could sustain year-round. Both month's temperatures averaged in the 70s and had max temperatures ranging in the 80s, which is great weather for W.avy's business. However, I would suggest an additional temperature query for months that are in the beginning of the year. I would also suggest a query for the precipitations of these specific months just to be safe.
